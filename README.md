Brian will present a brief primer on the seasonal package, developed by Christoph Sax to provide 
an R interface to the X-13ARIMA-SEATS seasonal adjustment and modeling software.  If time permits,
he will show more advanced capabilities and examples from package he has developed to simplify 
common seasonal adjustment and plotting tasks.
